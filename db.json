You can spin up your local environment with docker-compose in just one single command. And thanks to the use of volume mounts, you are able to hot reload your application in seconds.\r\n\r\nIn this blog post, we want to go a step forward and explain why you should develop your Django + Celery app directly in Kubernetes. The benefits are:\r\n\r\n    Reduce integration issues by developing in a more production-like environment, consuming Kubernetes manifests, secrets, volumes or config maps from development.\r\n    Overcome local development limitations. You will be able to develop against any Kubernetes cluster, local or remote. And having a lot of microservices makes it harder and harder to run the entire development environment locally.",

    "body": "One of the common questions we get when it comes to learning how to program, is: \u201cWhat are some good ideas for projects to build?\u201d\r\n\r\nNow, we hear the common cliche answers often, like \u201cbuild a chess game\u201d or \u201ccommand line interface\u201d. There is nothing wrong with these answers.\r\n\r\nHowever, we think these examples don\u2019t match modern programming needs. A big portion of modern software is SaaS and web apps. This means you need to know how to program online.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot more complexities that go into programming a website, or app, that has users, requires servers, authentication, and databases. This forces you to interact with technologies you\u2019ll never need when developing a command line tic-tac-toe game.\r\n\r\nSome of this can also be managed by AWS and other third parties that are commonly used by large corporations. Again, exposing you to technologies that are useful and heavily used in industry. This will be far more practical on a resume, as well as help you learn how to use new technologies.\r\n\r\nTip: If you pick a complex project, then focus on building one feature at a time. Building an entire website or app all at once is difficult. Start by building a login page, or maybe the main landing page after the user logs in. If you try to take on the whole project at once then you will likely fail.",

However, it doesn't have exploratory views that show summaries or historical trends which is something you'd expect from an admin dashboard.\r\n\r\nLuckily, the django admin app is extensible and with a few tweaks we can add interactive Javascript charts to the admin.\r\nProblem\r\n\r\nI wanted to get a graph overview of the email subscribers over time on findwork.dev. Is the site growing or stagnating in terms of email subscribers? How many subscribers did we have last month? What week did we gain most subscribers? Are all subscribers verifying their emails?\r\n\r\nUsing exploratory charts we can get a historical overview to how our site is performing.\r\n\r\nI initially explored the land of ready-made Django admin apps and dashboards. The requirements were that it included charting abilities, was well documented and looked good. While all of the apps I experimented with looked better that the default admin in terms of styling, they were either lacking in documentation or were unmaintained.\r\n\r\n    xadmin - no documentation in English\r\n    django-jet - unmaintained since the core team is working on a SaaS alternative\r\n    django-grapinelli - no charting ability\r\n\r\nThat's when an idea sprung to mind: why not extend the default admin app?\r\nExtending django-admin\r\n\r\nThe django admin app is composed ModelAdmin classes. These represent the visual view of your model in the admin interface. By default a ModelAdmin class comes with 5 default views:\r\n\r\n    ChangeList - a list view of a model collection\r\n    Add - a view that allows you to add a new model instance\r\n    Change - a view for updating a model instance\r\n    Delete - a view for confirming deletion of a model instance\r\n    History - history of actions taken on model instance\r\n\r\nThe ChangeList view is the default admin view when you want to see a particular model. I wanted to add a chart here so that any time I open the EmailSubscribers page I'd be presented with the added subscribers over time.",
